# hugo-theme-ulmer

This aims to be a simple, clean, responsive Hugo theme based on CSS Grid.

It's so incomplete that I'm not even using it yet myself, but progress is being made!

My work here is highly influenced by the [CleanWhite Hugo Theme][1], which was in turn influenced by the [Hux Blog][2] and [Clean Blog Jekyll][3] Themes. However, I completely re-implemented the entire theme from scratch. While pretty, CleanWhite simply carried baggage that made it hard for me to make even trivial modifications.
